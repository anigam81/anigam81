--- Outcomes of the project--
--1. We have segregated the data by, Age, Travelling class and flight distance
--2. For age we have taken two goups of age between 18 -40 & 41 -60 as 85.5% of total passgeners lies in it
--3. For travelling class we have taken Eco & Business class as 93.6% of total passgeners lies in it
--4. For distance we have taken flight distance less then 1200 as 65 % of total passgeners lies in it
